 \frametitle{Introduction}

 This executive presentation is made to describe the whole story behind our Box2D project.

 We would like to mention some of the interesting things in our project,challenges faced and how we overcame them.

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Interesting things in our project}
These are the things which we found interesting in our project
 \begin{itemize}
 
 \item The SWAG concept implemented by us
 \item Design of W and G in SWAG that is introducing those wavy paths
 \item Using balloons by introducing negative gravity
 \item And finally the pressure transferring system where we used Pascal's law
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Challenges faced during the implementation}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item While trying to introduce the balloons using negative gravity they were deviating in different directions  but we need all of them to go in a direction.
 \item In the implementation of conveyor belt,we initially tried to implement the original conveyor belt where the belt moves along with the wheels but ultimately came up with a design which gives the effect of a conveyor belt.
 \item While implementing Pascal's law where we used the heavy ball to apply large force on one side,the system we prepared was very delicate.
 \item In the formation of A in SWAG.
\end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Conclusion}
 We have used a lot of concets learnt in our labs.Some of them are
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Box2D simulation of our lab03.
 \item Makefiles
 \item Inkscape
 \item Using Doxygen for documentation
 \item Latex and presentions in beamer which are useful for presenting the work neatly
 \item Profiling using gprof.
\end{itemize}
