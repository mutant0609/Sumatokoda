\section{What is our project?}
We made a Rube GoldBerg Machine using Box2D,a 2D rigid body simulation library.We named it {\bf {The SWAG Machine}}.We named it so because ultimatly after simulation the word SWAG appers on the screen.In addition to this it provides food and drinks for the human sitting below.  \\ \\
\section{Our original project idea!}
In our project we are using dominos,pulley system,balloons,pendulums,planks,balls,containers,funnel,conveyor belts,motor system,human design,pascals system(which follows pascals law)..etc as major components in our project.Ultimately our major goal is to provide food and drinks for the human and the word SWAG to appear finally in the simulation.\\
 Initially there exists a pendulum oscillatinng in the left-top which triggers the movement of dominos on the left and a ball on the right.\\ \\
 On the left side the movement of a domino triggers the movement of all other dominoson the first plank and the last domino on the plank is hinged to it.Similarly this last domino triggers the other dominos on the second plank and ultimately leading to the formation of S.And the movement of the block on the third plank is triggered by the last domino on the third plank.This falls on the conveyor belt below and sensors are used to detect the collision between the block and conveyor belt and give it a force towards right.This block hits the ball which in turn hits the domino on its right and the movement of dominos ultimately leading to the formation of half part of A.\\ \\
 On the right side when the bob of pendulum hits the ball the ball bounces two times on the two horizontal planks in W and after final bounce it goes through passage in D and hits the block.This block falls on the rotating motor and ultimately the block falls in the conveyor belt whose movement leads to the formation of another half part of A as deccribed above.\\
 This completes the SWAG formation.\\ \\
 Coming to the food and drinks to be provided to the human,this implementation starts below the SWAG.The balls in the left most container below SWAG leak through the gap and throgh the passage they go into the right container of the pulley system.While this right container is moving up it hits the plank on its right and with the movement of hot air balloons this moves and triggers the movement of plank on which drinks are placed.This completes providing drinks to the human.\\ \\
 On the right side below the SWAG a heavy ball near G is triggered by the rotating motor which passes through the funnel and this heavy ball pushes the food in the right container and using the conclusions of Pascal's law the food comes out from the passage in the left container and ultimately goes into the bowl near human.This completes the total implementation.\\ \\ \\ \\

\section{Reasons for deviation from original project design}
We changed some parts of design due to physical constraints on motion of few objects.
We did not add the conveyor to right since it was very difficult to make the block on stem of G fall on it.
Also, due to shortage of space in the actual frame, we removed the food on right of man, and changed that part to a smiley.
Due to space constraints, we also changed the channeled path on the left on bottom by a single slant segment to channel balls,
instead of 3 slant segments.
Also, we changed the curved design of G to straight segments, since implementation of curved parts was not very good to look in 
the final simulation.\\
